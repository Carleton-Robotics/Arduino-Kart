GOAL: 
* Allow user to input a percentage of maximum length, 
  and break actuator moves to that percentage

RECORDED VALUES:
* it takes 10.6 seconds to reach FULL EXTENSION
* FULL EXTENSION (measuring from tip of actuator): 122mm
* FULL RETRACTION (measuring from tip of actuator): 22mm
* moves 100mm in 11 seconds

CALCULATIONS:
* 100mm/11seconds
* 20mm/2.2seconds
